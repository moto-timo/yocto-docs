Welcome to the Yocto Project Security Manual. This manual provides relevant
procedures necessary for dealing with security-related tasks supported in the
Yocto Project environment. This manual groups related procedures into
higher-level sections. Procedures can consist of high-level steps or low-level
steps depending on the topic.

This manual provides the following:

-  Procedures that help you securing an image with features supported by the
   Yocto Project; for example making a root filesystem read-only.

-  Procedures related to processes outside of the target images; for example how
   to deal with vulnerabilities.

This manual does not provide the following:

-  Procedures on security features implemented outside of
   :term:`OpenEmbedded-Core (OE-Core)`.

-  Documentation on the security mechanisms themselves, which can often be found
   in the documentation of the feature itself. This manual focuses on how to
   integrate the security mechanism within the Yocto Project.
